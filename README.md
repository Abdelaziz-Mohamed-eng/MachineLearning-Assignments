# Machine Learning Assignments  

This repository contains a task on analyzing the **Credit Card dataset** using Python.  
The main goal is to explore customer behavior and apply **clustering techniques** to group similar customers.

## 🔑 Key Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Dropping ID columns.  
   - Handling missing values using median.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Histograms for feature distributions.  
   - Correlation heatmap.  
   - Pairplots for sample features.  
   - Boxplots to detect outliers.  

3. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Standardizing features with `StandardScaler`.  

4. **Clustering**  
   - Applying **KMeans clustering**.  
   - Evaluating results using **Silhouette Score**.
